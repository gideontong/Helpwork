# Helpwork

Helpwork is a homework helper app that allows one central hub to ask and get answers to homework problems, as well as organize your agenda and see where you did math problems incorrectly.

## Getting Started

This app is written in React Native.

You'll need Node installed, and then you'll have to run:

```bash
npm install
```

Unfortunately, at the time of creation, the `package-lock.json` file was lost, but can easily be regenerated by a new user. Should you want to commit this file, feel free to submit a pull request for [Gideon Tong](mailto:gideon@gideontong.com) to review.

To begin debug:

```bash
npm start
```

To compile:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

## Origin

The idea of Helpwork was originally created by Gideon Tong, Marc Choi, and Logan Chiu at UCLA's 2018 Hacakdemia hackathon. See the contributor's graph to see how much contributions each person made.
