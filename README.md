# Helpwork
Helpwork is a homework helper app that allows one central hub to ask and get answers to homework problems, as well as organize your agenda and see where you did math problems incorrectly.

This app is written in React Native.

To begin debug:

```
npm start
```

To compile:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

## History
The idea of Helpwork was spawned by Gideon Tong, Logan Chiu, and Marc Choi at UCLA's Hackademia 2018 hackathon. No code was written by Logan Chiu or Marc Choi, and shortly thereafter Gideon Tong continued the project on his own.
