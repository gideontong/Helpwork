# Helpwork
Helpwork is a homework helper app where the idea was spawned by Gideon Tong, Logan Chiu, and Marc Choi at UCLA's Hackademia 2018 hackathon. 

This app is written in React Native.

To debug:

```
npm start

To compile:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```
